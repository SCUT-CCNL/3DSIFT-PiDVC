# 3DSIFT PiDVC
3D SIFT aided Path-independent Digital Volume Correlation, a multi-thread CPU implementation.



Digital volume correlation is an non-invasive technique for measuring internal deformation between two volumetric images obtained before and after deformation. The DVC calculation runs on the two volume images, resulting the deformation vectors of points of interest (POIs) that are set on the reference image (image before deformation).

The computation of each POI is independent to other POIs in PiDVC . And the local image area around the POI (called as subvolume) is used in calculation. Hence the subvolume size should be set before calculation.



The DVC method aided by 3D SIFT is adaptive to large and complex deformation (*reference [3]*). Besides, the PiDVC method using FFT-CC is also provided (*reference  [1]*).  This work is based on our previous work on SIFT aided PiDIC, readers interested to the SIFT aided method can refer to the *reference [2]*.

This program is written in C++ language and parallelized using OpenMp.

### DVC Algorithm

Two path-independent Digital volume (PiDVC) correlation methods are provided in this project:

1. 3D SIFT aided PiDVC
   - feature-based, adaptive to large and complex deformation
   - time-consuming
2. FFT-CC PiDVC
   - suitable to small deformation

## How to use

**The DVC program is now running on command line, by passing the path of the configuration file. The settings of the calculation is read from the input configuration file (i.e. yml format).**

The guide consists of the following four parts.

###ã€€Build the program from source

The steps of compiling and running the program is as follows:

1. clone the git repository 

2. init and update the submodule by commands

   - ```bash
     git submodule init
     git submodule update
     ```

3. Open the visual studio project `.sln` file.

4. Set the Windows SDK version of the visual studio project to that are installed on your PC. PS: version below  10.0.17763.0 is non-tested.

5. Build the release version of the program in visual studio

### Modify input configuration file

The configuration files are text files in *yml* format, several example configuration files are provided in path `Example/`.

Users might set the configuration file according to the following description

#### Essential fields

The following fields must be valid in calculation.

- `filepath` - `ref` - `image`
  -  path to the reference image (nifti format)
- `filepath` - `tar` - `image`
  -  path to the target image (nifti format)
- `filepath` - `result_dir`
  -  path to **directory** where the output text file is put inside
- `roi` - `mode`
  -  mode of ROI. This filed should be `cuboid` or `import`
- `roi` - `subset_radius`
  -  size of the subvolume (including x, y and z dimensions) *(integer values)*.
- `dvc` - `initial` - `method`
  -  method of initial guess. This field should be `PiSIFT` , `FFT-CC`  or `IOPreset`.
- `dvc` - `iterative` - `icgn_max_iter`
  -  the maximum iteration number of 3D IC-GN *(integer values)*.
- `dvc` - `iterative` - `icgn_deltaP`
  -  the convergence threshold of increment of displacement components *(floating point value)*.
- `dvc` - `num_thread`
  - number of threads *(integer value)*.

#### ROI settings

There are two kinds of ROI settings, users should set `roi` - `mode` as one of them .

- `cuboid`

  - A cuboid matrix of POIs are generated according to several fields:
  - required fields:
    - `roi` - `start_coor`, the start point of POI matrix (e.g. the POI closest to the (0,0,0))  *(integer values)*.
    - `roi` - `poi_num`, the dimensions of the POI matrix  *(integer values)*.
    - `roi` - `grid_space`, the space of adjacent POIs along different directions (x-axis, y-axis and z-axis) *(integer values)*.

- `import`

  - The coordinates of POIs are read from a text file

  - required fields:

    - `filepath` - `poi_coor`, the path to text file storing coordinates of POIs. 

  - In the text file, coordinate of each POI occupies a line, and the x,y and z coordinates are listed one by one and are separated by a comma.

  - Example:

    - ```
      50,60,70
      55,60,70
      ```

    - In this example, there are two POIs, the first is at (50,60,70) and the second is at (55,60,70). 

#### Initial estimation settings

There are three kinds of initial guess settings, users should set `dvc` - `initial` - `method` as one of them.

- `PiSIFT` 
  - 3D SIFT aided estimation
  - required fields:
    - `dvc` - `initial` - `ransac_error`, the error threshold in fitting affine matrix using RANSAC *(floating point value)*.
    - `dvc` - `initial` - `ransac_max_iter`, the maximum iteration number of RANSAC *(integer value)*.
    - `dvc` - `initial` - `min_neighbor`, the least number of nearby keypoints around a POI required for estimation *(integer value)*.
  
- `FFT-CC`
  - FFT-CC estimation
  - no extra required fields

- `IOPreset`

  - the initial value of each POI is obtained from a text file rather than using any algorithm to calculate

  - required:

    - the  `roi` - `mode` must be `import`
    - the initial value is after the coordinate of the POI in the text file set in `filepath` - `poi_coor`

  - Example:

    - ```
      50,60,70,1,2,3,-0.3,0.7,0,-0.7,-0.28,0,0,0,0
      55,60,70,2,1,3,-0.4,0.6,0,-0.6,-0.4,0,0,0,0
      ```

    - each POI occupies a line, and the initial values are `x,y,z,u,v,w,ux,uy,uz,vx,vy,vz,wx,wy,wz` , respectively
